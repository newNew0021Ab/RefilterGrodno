Preconnected origins

[preconnect](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/performance/uses-rel-preconnect/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr) hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made.

Accessibility

These checks highlight opportunities to [improve the accessibility of your web app](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/lighthouse/accessibility/?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr). Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so [manual testing](https://web.dev/articles/how-to-review?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr) is also encouraged.

Best practices

`[user-scalable="no"]` is used in the `<meta name="viewport">` element or the `[maximum-scale]` attribute is less than 5.

Disabling zooming is problematic for users with low vision who rely on screen magnification to properly see the contents of a web page. [Learn more about the viewport meta tag](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/meta-viewport).

`[aria-*]` attributes match their roles

Each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the `aria-*` attributes. [Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-allowed-attr).

`[aria-hidden="true"]` is not present on the document `<body>`

Assistive technologies, like screen readers, work inconsistently when `aria-hidden="true"` is set on the document `<body>`. [Learn how `aria-hidden` affects the document body](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-hidden-body).

`[role]` s have all required `[aria-*]` attributes

Some ARIA roles have required attributes that describe the state of the element to screen readers. [Learn more about roles and required attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-required-attr).

`[role]` values are valid

ARIA roles must have valid values in order to perform their intended accessibility functions. [Learn more about valid ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-roles).

`[aria-*]` attributes have valid values

Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid values. [Learn more about valid values for ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-valid-attr-value).

`[aria-*]` attributes are valid and not misspelled

Labels ensure that form controls are announced properly by assistive technologies, like screen readers. [Learn more about form element labels](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/label).

ARIA attributes are used as specified for the element's role

Some ARIA attributes are only allowed on an element under certain conditions. [Learn more about conditional ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-conditional-attr).

`[aria-hidden="true"]` elements do not contain focusable descendents

Focusable descendents within an `[aria-hidden="true"]` element prevent those interactive elements from being available to users of assistive technologies like screen readers. [Learn how `aria-hidden` affects focusable elements](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-hidden-focus).

`<html>` element has a `[lang]` attribute

If a page doesn't specify a `lang` attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader.

Uses HTTPS

All sites should be protected with HTTPS, even ones that don't handle sensitive data. This includes avoiding [mixed content](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr), where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs.

`[aria-*]` attributes match their roles

Each ARIA `role` supports a specific subset of `aria-*` attributes. Mismatching these invalidates the `aria-*` attributes. [Learn how to match ARIA attributes to their roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-allowed-attr).

`[aria-hidden="true"]` is not present on the document `<body>`

Assistive technologies, like screen readers, work inconsistently when `aria-hidden="true"` is set on the document `<body>`. [Learn how `aria-hidden` affects the document body](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-hidden-body).

`[role]` s have all required `[aria-*]` attributes

Some ARIA roles have required attributes that describe the state of the element to screen readers. [Learn more about roles and required attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-required-attr).

`[role]` values are valid

ARIA roles must have valid values in order to perform their intended accessibility functions. [Learn more about valid ARIA roles](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-roles).

`[aria-*]` attributes have valid values

Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid values. [Learn more about valid values for ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-valid-attr-value).

`[aria-*]` attributes are valid and not misspelled

Assistive technologies, like screen readers, can't interpret ARIA attributes with invalid names. [Learn more about valid ARIA attributes](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/aria-valid-attr).

When a button doesn't have an accessible name, screen readers announce it as "button", making it unusable for users who rely on screen readers. [Learn how to make buttons more accessible](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/button-name).

Image elements have `[alt]` attributes

Informative elements should aim for short, descriptive alternate text. Decorative elements can be ignored with an empty alt attribute. [Learn more about the `alt` attribute](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/image-alt).

Form elements have associated labels

Labels ensure that form controls are announced properly by assistive technologies, like screen readers. [Learn more about form element labels](https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.11/label).

`<html>` element has a `[lang]` attribute

If a page doesn't specify a `lang` attribute, a screen reader assumes that the page is in the default language that the user chose when setting up the screen reader.

Uses HTTPS

All sites should be protected with HTTPS, even ones that don't handle sensitive data. This includes avoiding [mixed content](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/prevent-mixed-content/what-is-mixed-content?utm_source=lighthouse&utm_medium=lr), where some resources are loaded over HTTP despite the initial request being served over HTTPS. HTTPS prevents intruders from tampering with or passively listening in on the communications between your app and your users, and is a prerequisite for HTTP/2 and many new web platform APIs.
